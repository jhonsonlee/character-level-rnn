## Character Level RNN with PyTorch
This repository is dedicated for who are new to Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). In theory, RNN is used for data which depends on historical pattern, such as stocks and human speech. This repo is part of Udacity Deeplearning Nanodegree Program which is originally from [Udacity Deep Learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch). Users are encouraged to learn basic theory in RNN first before proceeding to this repository.

## Quick Start
There are three notebooks in this repo:
1. `Character_Level_RNN_Exercise.ipynb` This is intended for exercise in which some parts are missing for users' own code.
2. `Character_Level_RNN_MySolution.ipynb` This is my solution written during my Nanodegree Program.
3. `Character_Level_RNN_Udacity_Solution.ipynb` This is solution from Udacity mentors.
